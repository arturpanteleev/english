# Согласование времен в английском языке

В английском языке существует два способа как передать чье-либо высказывание:**прямая речь **и **косвенная**\(непрямая\)**речь**.

**Direct speech**\(прямая речь\) – это буквальная передача чьего-то высказывания \(а также своего личного высказывания\), передача чьей-то речи слово в слово. Прямая речь с обеих сторон выделяется **кавычками **и отделяется от вводных слов **запятой**\(реже двоеточием\).

## Таблица согласования времен в английском языке

| **Время в прямой речи⠀** | **Время придаточного в косвенной речи⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Present Simple | Past Simple |
| Present Continuous | Past Continuous |
| Present Perfect | Past Perfect |
| Past Continuous | Past Perfect Continuous |
| Past Simple | Past Perfect |
| Future Indefinite | Future Indefinite in the Раst |

**Исключения:**

Время в придаточном предложении может остаться без изменения, если в нем указано точное время:

> He told us, “I **took part** in the Moscow Olympic games in 1980.”  
> Он сказал нам: «Я принимал участие в Московских Олимпийских играх 1980 года».
>
> He told us he **took part** in the Moscow Olympic games in 1980.  
> Он рассказал нам, что в 1980 году принимал участие в Московских Олимпийских играх.

Или если идет речь об общеизвестном факте:

> Newton proved that bodies **attract** each other.  
> Ньютон доказал, что тела притягивают друг друга.

Или если говорящий **ссылается на слова, которые только что были сказаны**:

> **Kate: "Stay with me, Mark. I will cook something delicious."**  
> – Кейт: Останься со мной, Марк. Я приготовлю что-нибудь вкусное.  
> **Mark to Elza: "Kate said she will cook something delicious."**  
> – Марк Эльзе: Кейт сказала, что приготовит что-то вкусное.

# Утверждения

Для того, чтобы перевести прямую речь в косвенную, нужно опустить запятую после слов, вводящих прямую речь, и кавычки. Часто косвенная речь в английском языке вводится союзом **that**, который, впрочем, может быть и опущен:

> I said, “It is June.”  
> Я сказал: «Сейчас июнь».
>
> I said that it was June. \(I said it was June.\)  
> Я сказал, что стоял июнь.

Все личные и притяжательные местоимения должны быть изменены в зависимости от лица, от которого ведется повествование:

> Tom and Bob told me, “**We** need **your** dictionary.”  
> Том и Боб сказали: «Нам нужен твой словарь».
>
> Tom and Bob told me that **they** need **my** dictionary.  
> Том и Боб сказали, что им нужен мой словарь.

Все указательные местоимения и наречия времени и места в придаточном предложении должны быть изменены по смыслу предложения:

* this —&gt; that
* these —&gt; those
* now —&gt; then
* today —&gt; that day
* tomorrow —&gt; next day
* the day after tomorrow —&gt; 2 days later
* yesterday —&gt; the day before
* the day before yesterday —&gt; 2 days before
* ago —&gt; before
* here —&gt; there

> She told me, “I will come to see you **tomorrow**.”  
> Она сказала мне: «Завтра я приду тебя проведать».
>
> She told me she would come to see me **the next day**.  
> Она сказала, что на следующий день придет меня проведать.

## Вопросы в косвенной речи

В косвенной речи вопросы имеют прямой порядок слов, а вопросительный знак в конце предложения заменяется на точку.

**Общие вопросы** вводятся союзами **if** и **whether**:

> I asked, “Have you seen my pen?”  
> Я спросил: «Ты видел мою ручку?»
>
> I asked him **if** he had seen my pen. \(I asked him **whether** he had seen my pen.\)  
> Я спросил, видел ли он мою ручку.

**Специальные вопросы** вводятся вопросительными словами:

> He wondered: “Who on earth will buy this junk?”  
> Он удивился: «Ну кто станет покупать эту рухлядь?»
>
> He wondered who on earth would buy that junk.  
> Он удивился, кто станет покупать эту рухлядь.

Краткий ответ на вопрос косвенной речи вводится союзом **that** без слов **yes** / **no**:

> She answered, “Yes, I do.”  
> Она ответила: «Да».
>
> She answered that she did.  
> Она ответила утвердительно.

## Повелительные предложения в косвенной речи

Такие предложения используются со словами **to say**, **to tell**, **to order**,  **to ask**, **to beg**, а глагол в повелительном наклонении изменяется в форму [инфинитива](https://www.native-english.ru/grammar/infinitive):

> Mom told me, “Clear your room.”  
> Мама сказала мне: «Прибери свою комнату».
>
> Mom told me to clear my room.  
> Мама сказала мне прибрать свою комнату.
>
> He said, “Don’t run in the corridor.”  
> Он сказал: «Не бегайте в коридоре».
>
> He said not to run in the corridor.  
> Он сказал не бегать в коридоре.
